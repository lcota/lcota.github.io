What is the Next Step
===================================

* Load ETF data
* Save to Disk
* Calc total returns
* Save to Disk

* Load CPI / ISM data & Align Dates
* Create refmonthyear column

* Examine relationship of CPI to stock returns
* Plot CPI with shaded regions, x > 3% inflation,  1% < x < 3%, x < 1%
* Create mask of high/medium/low CPI

* Remove short history tickers (XT, IHI)
* create monthly returns series
* add ref month year col to monthly returns
* create monthly total return series
* merge monthly returns with cpifred data
* create HML for PMI and NMI 

* Summary table of avg monthly return per sector for HML CPI
* Summary table of avg monthly return per sector for HML NMI
* Summary table of avg monthly return per sector for HML PMI
* barchart showing returns per sector in each regime - CPI 
* barchart showing sector returns | NMI regime 
* barchart showing sector returns | PMI regime 
* Parse and join Sector Index data 

* Create forward returns dataset

* Create mean monthly returns for fwd return periods for CPI/PMI/NMI HML regimes
* Test for significance of excess returns != 0

* Trading Rules 
	Forward periods: 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y
	Backward Window: 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y

	Is Current - 3Mth ago higher? then rising
	Is current - rolling 12month higher? then rising
	Are returns higher or lower compared to unconditional returns?

	What is the trading rule? Long what, short what, when? 


	What is the behavior of cointegrated relationships? 

* Next Steps 
	* Apply trading rules using Forecasts
	* Write draft of 1st paper

* Follow up paper 1
	* Apply trading rule using NMI/PMI backward looking sector selection


* Follow up paper 2
	* Implement Fama French & test improvement with CPI / NMI / PMI to estimate forward returns



** If CPI is rising, what do forward returns look like?  
** If PMI is rising, what do forward returns look like? 
** If NMI is rising, what do forward returns look like?  
   


 * Next Steps: 
 * Writeup of historical empirical relationship between CPI and Equity Sectors
 	Charts of regimes in Excel
 	Charts of sectors x CPI returns in Excel 
 	Transfer summary notes to Word Document format for Turnleaf
